# Stori Card Challenge

Hi, I prepared this challenge for the guys from StoriCard

## Problem and proposed solution

StoriCard needs a way to generate account resumes from users, these resumes will be sent by mail and should share information about the last few months' transactions and account balance.

For this I will create a worker in golang that will read a CSV file, this worker will store the data in a SQLite database and send an email with the resume.


## The Mail

## How I imagine this on producction

The solution I thought of is quite basic because it is only to solve the specific exercise.

Despite that, I took the time to prepare, as I imagine, a similar solution, for a productive environment so that this development can scale correctly.
